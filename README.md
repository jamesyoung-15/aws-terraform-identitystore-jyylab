# My AWS Identity Store Setup with Terraform

My terraform setup for AWS SSO with AWS Idenitity Store for AWS organization.

## Setup

- Create organization (setup OUs, add accounts, etc.), my setup [here](https://github.com/jamesyoung-15/aws-organization-jyylab/)
- Enable SSO on management console (to my knowledge has to be done manually)
- Setup user info `identity_store_users` with right email
